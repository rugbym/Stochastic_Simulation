This repository contains the coding work to complete assignment 1 of stochastic simulation.

Assignment1.ipynb shows the usage of the functions and classes contained in the files in the libraries folder.
These files contain functions to create a mandelbrot set image, compute the area of the mandelbrot set using monte carlo integration using different sampling methods.

The requirements.txt file contains the requirements to set up a conda environment that has the required packages.

Standard packages like numpy and matplotlib are used, however the packages numba and SciencePlots may need more careful installation.
